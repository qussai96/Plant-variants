# Plant-Variants  
Linking Plant Variants to Their Functional Impact  

This script processes files from the Ensembl Plants database and extends the GVF file to include information about the mutation's position in the protein sequence and its impact on protein function.  

The generated output can be used to train machine learning models for studying the functional consequences of genetic variants in plants.

Input files can be downloaded from Ensembl Plant at https://plants.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html
